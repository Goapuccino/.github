Hello and welcome to the GitHub-Page of the Goapuccino!
We are a student-cafe based in Hamburg, Germany. 
Since 2008, we are delivering coffee and other snacks to our fellow high-school students at Gymnasium Oberalster.
Here on GitHub, we store code for some of our internal tools, including our DIY, RFID-secured Cashdesk.
Feel free to contact us!
